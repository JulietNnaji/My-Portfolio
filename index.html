              Juliet Nnaji is a multi-passionate creative. Some say she is a
              notable Writer, others say she is one of the best spoken word
              poets they have come across; with the way she uses her voice to
              tell stories about social issues affecting people, especially
              women. She says she is a jack of all trades and master of some, a
              performance poet, content creator, author of two books, front-end
              developer and soon to be trilingual.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a spoken word artist, she has performed at some notable events,
              including Moonlight tales 2019, Cedar Fest 2020, LABAF 2018 &
              2020, and LIPFEST 2021. Her poem "If The Country is a Book" was
              personally read and selected by Prof. Wole Soyinka after which she
              performed it at the World poetry day event 2019 organized by
              providus bank. She was also part of the poets selected in the
              WO2WA poetry exchange between West Oakland California and West
              Africa, Lagos, Nigeria.
