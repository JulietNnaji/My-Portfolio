        Juliet Nnaji is a multi-passionate creative. Some say she is a notable Writer,
        others say she is one of the best spoken word poets they have come
        across; with the way she uses her lovely voice to tell stories about
        social issues affecting people, especially women. She says she is a jack
        of all trades and master of some, a performance poet, content creator,
        author of two books, front-end developer and soon to be trilingual.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a spoken word artist, she has performed at some notable events,
        including Moonlight tales 2019, Cedar Fest 2020, LABAF 2018 & 2020, and
        LIPFEST 2021. Her poem "If The Country is a Book" was personally read
        and selected by Prof. Wole Soyinka after which she performed it at the
        World poetry day event 2019 organized by providus bank. She was also
        part of the poets selected in the WO2WA poetry exchange between West
        Oakland California and West Africa, Lagos, Nigeria.
        <br />
        <br />
        When she is not connecting with people, she loves reading, writing,
        coding and cooking delicacies.
